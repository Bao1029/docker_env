# ovn switch back to local gateway mode

[reference](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1996108)

```

After some discussion we will support the previous functionality of routing all egress traffic via the kernel. This will allow the previous behavior to continue working. This mode of ovn-kubernetes is called "local gateway" mode, while the default mode in 4.8 and later is called "shared gateway" mode. Local gateway mode still exists in 4.8 and later, it is just only enabled right now via a hidden configuration. As a workaround for now, I'll provide the instructions for enabling this mode. However, we will come up with a proper configuration knob exposed via cluster network config to switch between gateway modes. Note, for now we only have validated that migrating from local gateway mode -> shared gateway mode works, and not the reverse. We will validate/fix this though. If a customer is relying on custom routes/iptables rules to steer egress traffic, it is advised to stay on local gateway mode when upgrading from 4.7->4.8->4.9. To do this:

So to deploy 4.8 or later with local gateway mode, you need to create a config-map to indicate that gateway mode and have it present at deploy/upgrade time. In order to do this for a fresh install:

1. put your install-config.yaml in the your <install folder>
2. openshift-install create-manifests --dir=<install folder>
3. create a file like this in the newly created manifests dir:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
    name: gateway-mode-config
    namespace: openshift-network-operator
data:
    mode: "local"
immutable: true
4. openshift-install create cluster --dir=<install folder>

I'll keep this bug open to address any issues with switching from shared gateway back to local gateway mode.
